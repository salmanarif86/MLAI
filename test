Absolutely. The prompt in the screenshot asks:

“What is our market share, any key deals, and contracts RBC has with ServiceNow?”

Here’s a professional response an AI assistant could generate for an investment banker, assuming it has access to typical sources like investor reports, deal databases, and internal CRM:

⸻

🧠 Market Share, Key Deals, and RBC’s Relationship with ServiceNow

1. Market Share (ServiceNow)
	•	ServiceNow holds an estimated 40–50% market share in the enterprise IT service management (ITSM) space.
	•	It leads the digital workflow automation segment, with significant adoption across financial services, government, and healthcare.
	•	Its Digital Workflow Products now account for 88.5% of total revenue, as seen in their latest FY report — marking a shift from core ITSM to full-stack enterprise operating platforms.

2. Key Deals
	•	Recent high-profile enterprise deals include:
	•	$10M+ contracts with multinational banks and insurance companies (names often undisclosed)
	•	Expansion into GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) modules within financial services
	•	Integration with hyperscalers (e.g., Microsoft Azure and AWS) to support banking-specific workflows

3. RBC’s Relationship with ServiceNow
	•	RBC has leveraged ServiceNow for:
	•	IT operations automation and incident management
	•	Enterprise-wide ticketing and workflow orchestration
	•	Potentially, GRC and HR onboarding modules across business units
	•	Specific contracts or dollar values are not publicly disclosed, but based on peer activity, RBC likely maintains a multi-year enterprise license agreement in the mid- to high-single-digit million CAD annually.

Perfect — you’re aiming to show granular prompt-response interaction, where the banker edits just one bullet within a larger meeting brief section (e.g. “Top Things to Know”), and the AI responds with an updated suggestion for that bullet only.

⸻

🔹 Example Setup: In-Context Interaction

Heading:
2. ServiceNow Q1 Revenue Beat

Subscription revenue grew 20% YoY to $3.05B, driven by enterprise renewals and upsell momentum.

⸻

🔹 Banker Prompt (Edit Request):

“Can you rewrite this to focus more on margin expansion instead of revenue growth?”

⸻

🔹 AI Response:

Revised:
ServiceNow’s Q1 results highlighted margin strength, with operating margin expanding to 30.5%—underscoring scalable delivery and disciplined cost control.

⸻

💡 Optional Add-on:

Add a “Replace” or “Accept” button next to the updated suggestion, so the user can seamlessly adopt the new bullet into the brief.

⸻

Would you like a few more examples of this interaction pattern? I can do one where the banker challenges sentiment, or another where the prompt asks to “make it punchier for a CFO.”

Would you like this framed in bullet points for the “Top Things to Know” section of the meeting brief, or exported into a pitch slide format?

Here’s a refined set of responses based on the “Top Things to Know” section from your AidenBanker UI, filling in missing “TEXT NEEDED” entries and expanding two items for deeper insight.

✅ Top Things to Know – Final Version

⸻

1. Key Personnel Changes

ServiceNow appointed Paul Smith as Chief Commercial Officer in April 2025, following the departure of Kevin Haverty. Paul previously led EMEA sales and is expected to focus on enterprise expansion in regulated markets.

⸻

2. ServiceNow Q1 Revenue Beat

Subscription revenue grew 20% YoY to $3.005B, driven by enterprise renewals and upsell momentum.
🔽 Expanded View:
The revenue beat was led by strength in Digital Workflow Products (88.5% of total revenue), especially in regulated sectors. North American enterprise retention exceeded 95%. This growth was also accompanied by FCF margin guidance of 32%, reinforcing operational leverage.

⸻

3. Earnings Call Sentiment

Analysts largely positive, but some flagged scalability risks in GTM and partner enablement.
🔽 Expanded View:
While Q1 results were solid, a few analyst notes raised concerns over the speed of enablement for new reseller channels and whether hypergrowth in digital workflows is sustainable at current hiring pace. However, bullish sentiment remained strong for large-cap SaaS resilience.

⸻

4. Last Meeting Topics

Previous meeting with CFO centered on strategic partnerships and post-deal integration—an ideal point to resume the conversation.

⸻

5. Critical Action Items from Last Meeting

RBC was to follow up with a proposed structure for co-development around ESG workflow automation. Client requested market comps and benchmarking for similar partnerships across tech-enabled service firms.

⸻

Would you like me to mock up how these expand/collapse states should behave visually or hand this off in Figma copy? I can also tag prompts to regenerate individual bullets just like your previous request.

Absolutely — here’s the same improved, banker-intuitive prompt with an added instruction to include one non-standard slide that could create an edge or provoke discussion in the room.

⸻

✅ Final Banker-Optimized Prompt with Differentiator

“I’m preparing a pitch book for Panera Bread, a privately held fast-casual restaurant chain backed by PE. The objective is to explore strategic M&A options — both potential acquisition targets and possible exit opportunities. I cover the consumer & retail sector. Can you generate a full outline for the deck, including all the usual sections like company overview, industry landscape, strategic alternatives, valuation, and execution roadmap — structured the way we’d present to a board or C-suite?
Also include one slide that’s not typically found in pitch books — something that could create differentiation or spark strategic discussion.”

⸻

🧠 Example of Non-Typical Slide the LLM Might Add:

“Digital Loyalty Flywheel & Data Monetization Potential”
Break down how Panera’s loyalty app data, cross-channel engagement, and predictive analytics could be turned into new revenue streams (e.g., personalized menus, dynamic pricing, B2B data partnerships).

This prompt nudges the LLM to think creatively, while still staying within the high-trust, high-stakes tone of an IB presentation.

Would you like me to generate the full outline output using this prompt now?
